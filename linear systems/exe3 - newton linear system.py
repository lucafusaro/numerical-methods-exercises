""". Write a script that uses the Newton-Raphson method to solve the following
system of two non-linear equations
sin (x y) + x = 2
y^2 âˆ’ x y = 3
Start by assuming x = 1 and y = 1, to find the closest solution to such values.
Suggestions:
1. Remember that the Newton-Raphson method is a root finding method.
2. Use pen and paper to write down the partial derivatives and the Jacobian matrix before you
start coding.
3. As demonstrated during the lectures, the Newton-Raphson method applied to a system of non-linear equations
 requires to iteratively solve a system of linear equations. Use
numpy.linalg.solve to solve this system of linear equations."""
